# React + Vite with Express.js and Node.js + MongoDB

Used a template that provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Setted up a database connection with the dataset on MongoDB Atlus, using Express.js for backend. 

Connect the backend server by calling node index.js in terminal of server folder before running react app if it does not already run on npm dev.
